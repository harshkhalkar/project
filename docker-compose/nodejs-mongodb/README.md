# Node.js + MongoDB Dockerized App

This is a simple full-stack application demonstrating how to use **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, all containerized using **Docker** and managed via **Docker Compose**.

When you access the root route `/`, it creates a new user named `"harsh"` in the MongoDB database and responds with a JSON message confirming the addition.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will:

- 🐳 Start a MongoDB container named mongo-db

- 🛠️ Build and start a Node.js app container named node-js

- 🌐 Create a Docker network (node-mongo) to allow communication between containers

- 💾 Create a persistent volume (mongodb) to store MongoDB data even after container restarts

🌐 Access the App
Expected response:
```bash
{
  "message": "User added!",
  "user": {
    "_id": "some-id",
    "name": "harsh",
    "__v": 0
  }
}
```
